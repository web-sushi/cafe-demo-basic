        <h2 class="section-title">Our Story</h2>
        <p class="lead-text">
          It all started with a simple question:<br />
          <em>What if coffee could be more than just caffeine?</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          In the spring of 2019, Maria and James found themselves in the same
          place many of us do, burnt out, overworked, and desperately missing
          the simple joys of life. Over lukewarm coffee in a generic chain cafe,
          they began dreaming out loud. What would their perfect coffee shop
          look like? What would it feel like? More importantly, what would it
          mean to their community?
        </p>
        <p>
          Six months later, armed with savings, support from family, and a whole
          lot of naive optimism, they signed the lease on a small corner space
          that had been everything from a barbershop to a bookstore over its
          hundred-year history. The bones were good, but everything else needed
          work. Friends pitched in on weekends, sanding floors and painting
          walls in exchange for the promise of free coffee for life, a promise
          we still honor today.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, Espresso Haven is more than a café. It's a gathering place
          where students find quiet corners to study, where friends reconnect
          over perfectly brewed lattes, and where neighbors become family. We
          source our beans directly from small farms, ensuring every cup
          supports sustainable practices and fair wages. Our pastries are baked
          fresh each morning, and our baristas are trained not just in
          technique, but in the art of making you feel welcome.
        </p>
        <p>
          We believe that great coffee is about connection to the land, to the
          people who grow it, and to each other. Come visit us, and let's share
          a cup together.
